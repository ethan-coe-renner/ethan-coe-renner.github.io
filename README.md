# About Me

Hi, I\'m Ethan Coe-Renner. I\'m a second year computer science student
studying at University of the Pacific. My interests include low level
systems programming, Linux, artificial intelligence, and the Rust
programming language.

# Projects

Here are some projects which I enjoyed making.

## [Teeny Tiny Compiler](https://github.com/ethan-coe-renner/teeny-tiny-compiler)

A compiler for teeny tiny written in rust during the summer of 2021.
Initially following [this
guide](https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html) by Austin
Henley, but with additions made by myself.

## [Rustbar (the second one)](https://github.com/ethan-coe-renner/rustbar-the-second-one)

A statusbar intended for use with the
[spectrwm](https://github.com/conformal/spectrwm) window manager.

## [Genetic Dots](https://github.com/ethan-coe-renner/geneticDots)

A genetic algorithm for pathfinding around obstacles. Created around
2018 in python with pygame, it is very bad at pathfinding due to local
optima (a notorious problem with genetic algorithms), but was a fun
exploration of genetic algorithms.

# Dotfiles

My [dotfiles](https://github.com/ethan-coe-renner/dotfiles) repository
for [NixOS](https://nixos.org), including configuration files for a
number of programs which I use. I use [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io) to
manage these files.
